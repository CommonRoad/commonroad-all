Updating the Meta-Package
-------------------------
The version numbers should always be fixed to avoid incompatibilities when individual packages have been updated. Steps for updating the meta-package:
* update dependencies in `setup.py`: Update list entries in `install_requires`
* update the version number of the meta-package
* build wheel and push to Pypi
